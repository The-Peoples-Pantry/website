Hello {{request.name}},
This is a message from The People's Pantry.
Your FoodShare produce box is scheduled to be delivered today. Just a reminder that boxes are delivered until 9 PM.  Please let us know once you receive your grocery box.
If you don’t receive your box by that time today, please let us know by replying to this message. When delivery drivers didn’t get to do the delivery because they ran out of time, they will schedule your delivery for the following day.
Gift cards are delivered SEPARATELY, either by mail (for physical gift cards, timing will depend on Canada post) or via email (be sure to check your spam folder!).
Thanks, and stay safe!
