<h1>Our grocery program is paused</h1>
<p>Dear Grocery community,</p>
<p>We will be putting a pause on our Grocery program after the end of July, meaning that Friday July 16 – Sunday July 18 is the last time we will be fielding grocery requests. All scheduled grocery deliveries will be completed.</p>
<p>We intend to re-open the program, once we have sufficient funding lined up, and we will let you know once that is the case.</p>
<p>It has been an honour and a privilege to be connected to you.</p>
<p>With care,<br/>The People’s Pantry Grocery Coordinators</p>
