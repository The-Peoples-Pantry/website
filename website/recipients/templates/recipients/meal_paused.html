<h1>Meal sign-ups paused</h1>
<p>Our meal sign-ups are temporarily paused while we work to deliver the requests we've already received. This form will re-open for meal requests each Friday at 9 AM and is open until Sunday 2 PM.</p>
<p>We are only able to fulfill {{settings.MEALS_LIMIT}} meal requests per week, and we will draw {{settings.MEALS_LIMIT}} request submissions on Sunday at 2 PM. We will contact you to let you know whether your request was selected. Requests that are selected will be available for our volunteer chefs to sign up, <strong>please note that scheduling meal deliveries is still dependent on chefs signing up, you will be contacted once a volunteer chef signs up for your request and your delivery is scheduled</strong>. Deliveries will be scheduled for Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.</p>
