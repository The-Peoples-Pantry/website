<h1>Community Cookbook</h1>
<p>
    The People's Pantry Community Cookbook has been in the works for over a year!
    We're so excited to finally launch this project to honour and commemorate our work as a mutual aid organization and all the partnerships, friendships, and connections we've made along the way.
    To keep supporting TPP you can download a PDF "Pay What You Can" version of our cookbook or you can purchase a hard copy for $20 by following the form below.
    We hope you'll help us celebrate this milestone and help spread the word. 
</p>
<p>
    Although not required to download a copy of our cookbook, we appreciate any and all donations to help support the continuation of our mutual aid project.
    To donate, please share your contribution via e-transfer to our treasurer, Jade, at jdacost5@yorku.ca, with "TPP Cookbook PDF" in the comments.
    No password required. Only e-transfer payments can be accepted.
</p>
<p>
    With care and in solidarity, The People's Pantry.
